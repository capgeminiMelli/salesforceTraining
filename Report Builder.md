## Use the Report Builder

When you create a report in Salesforce, the criteria you enter is essentially a question you’re asking, and the results returned are the answer. But in order to ask a question, you have to speak the database’s language. Good news! Salesforce comes with a built-in translator, allowing you to ask your database all the questions you want through a point-and-click interface. Meet the drag-and-drop report builder, your way to get the answers you need about your data.

The first thing you need to do is make sure you’ve enabled the report builder. New organizations automatically get the latest version of report builder. For existing organizations, you may need to take steps to enable the drag-and-drop report builder.


Now that you’ve built a filter, let’s take this to the next level with cross-object filters, or “cross filters.” These allow you to extend your report types to objects related to the original objects defined in the report type. Cross filters help you fine tune your results, without writing code or using formulas. The most common use case is exception reporting. Here are some examples.

-   ‘Stale Opportunities’ - Opportunities without activities in the past 30 days
-   ‘Orphan Contacts’ - Contacts without Accounts
-   ‘Neglected Accounts’ - Accounts with no Opportunities
