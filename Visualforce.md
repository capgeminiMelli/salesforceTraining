## What is Visualforce

The last major pillar of coding on the Salesforce platform is Visualforce. If you’ve done any web development, Visualforce will feel familiar to you. Visualforce lets you create and customize pages in Salesforce as well as integrate with other standard web technologies, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Before we look at an example, it’s important to talk about the difference between Lightning components and Visualforce pages. The primary difference is right in the name. With Lightning components, you’re developing components that can be pieced together to create pages. With Visualforce, you’re developing entire pages at once. While Lightning components are newer and better for things like mobile development, there are several situations where it can make more sense to use Visualforce. Take a look at the table in [User Interface Development Considerations](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/en/modules/lex_dev_overview/units/lex_dev_overview_future) for more details on when to use which one.


## ASP.NET to Visualforce

Visualforce is a framework for rendering HTML pages using an MVC paradigm. Now before you get all excited and start thinking, “Cool, Visualforce is like ASP.NET MVC. I love MVC.”, keep in mind that comparing the two is a bit like comparing apples and pumpkins. You can use either one to render web pages, and both separate the application logic from the markup and the database model, but they do so in different ways.
