## Lightning Components

The Lightning Component framework is a user interface development framework for desktop and mobile. As its name suggests, it’s a component-based approach to UI development. Using prebuilt and custom Lightning components, you can quickly develop sleek and consistent UIs for your apps.

If you’re familiar with frameworks like AngularJS, React, or Polymer, you have a good idea of what to expect with Lightning components. The benefit, of course, is that Lightning components are ready to go with all your business data in Salesforce.
