Salesforce is your customer success platform, designed to help you sell, service, market, analyze, and connect with your customers.

Salesforce has everything you need to run your business from anywhere. Using standard products and features, you can manage relationships with prospects and customers, collaborate and engage with employees and partners, and store your data securely in the cloud.

But standard products and features are only the beginning. Our platform allows you to customize and personalize the experience for your customers, partners, and employees and easily extend beyond out of the box functionality.

So where does [[CRM]] fit in to all of this? Let's start by defining what CRM is.

## A Quick Introduction to Salesforce

You might think that Salesforce is just a CRM. It stores your customer data, gives you processes to nurture prospective customers, and provides ways to collaborate with people you work with. And it does all those things. But saying that Salesforce is “just a CRM” is like saying a house is just a kitchen. There’s a lot more to it than that.

Salesforce comes with a lot of **standard functionality**, or out-of-the-box products and features that you can use to run your business. Here are some common things businesses want to do with Salesforce and the features we give you that support those activities.

## Architecture
-   Salesforce is a cloud company. Everything we offer resides in the trusted, multitenant cloud.
-   The Salesforce platform is the foundation of our services. It’s powered by metadata and made up of different parts, like data services, artificial intelligence, and robust APIs for development.
-   All our apps sit on top of the platform. Our prebuilt offerings like Sales Cloud and Marketing Cloud, along with apps you build using the platform, have consistent, powerful functionality.
-   Everything is integrated. Our platform technologies like predictive analytics and the development framework are built into everything we offer and everything you build.


This idea is **multitenancy**. Multitenancy is a great word for making you sound smart at dinner parties, but really all it means is that you’re sharing resources. Salesforce provides a core set of services to all our customers in the multitenant cloud. No matter the size of your business, you get access to the same computing power, data storage, and core features.
