At the heart of Trailhead and the Trailblazer Community is you—our Trailblazer. A trailblazer is: 

-   A pioneer; an innovator; a lifelong learner; a mover and shaker.
-   A leader who leaves a path for others to follow.
-   Most importantly, a person who builds a better world for others.

Trailhead and the Trailblazer Community are part of one unified platform. The Trailblazer Community helps you learn relevant skills, connect with other Trailblazers, and give back. Together, Trailhead and the Trailblazer Community are your one-stop shop to learn, earn, and connect from anywhere. Whether you’re an admin just starting out, a graduate fresh from college, a Salesforce user, or just someone who loves to learn, there’s something on Trailhead for you.

## What’s the Difference Between a Trailhead Playground and a Developer Edition Org?

If you’re used to trying out new Salesforce features and playing around in a development environment, you might already have a Developer Edition (DE) org. A DE org is an org that we provide for free to test new features and implementations in Salesforce without affecting a production org.

A Trailhead Playground is like a DE org, but specifically for Trailhead. Trailhead Playgrounds come with Trailhead-specific data, and a pre-installed package that we use to test your hands-on challenges. Trailhead Playgrounds also include tools to make some of the tasks you’ll find yourself completing often easier, such as finding your username and resetting your password, and installing managed packages.

If you’d rather use an existing DE org, though, we understand. Just click the name of your org at the bottom of any hands-on challenge or project step and then click **Connect Org** and log in to your DE org. Once you’ve linked your DE org to your Trailhead account, you’ll be able to launch it from any hands-on challenge.
