## Establish Your Goals

Before you start implementing Sales Cloud, it’s essential to take the time to define how it can work for your business. 

The first step is to identify your business goals and how Sales Cloud can help you achieve them. Even if your team has already determined what it wants out of Sales Cloud before purchasing, now’s the time to revisit and formalize those goals.

Let’s look at how one company defined its goals for Sales Cloud.

Linda Rosenberg, admin for a shoe manufacturing company called Cloud Kicks, recently implemented Sales Cloud to better track the company’s revenue. Her team wants to achieve the following:

When defining your business goals, consider these questions:
- What will my business look like in 3 to 5 years
- what future customer needs do i want to satisfy
- what are the top pain points my business experiences today that we hope to fix. 

## Define Your Key Metrics 

Once you outline your business goals, the next step is to match these goals with how you’ll measure success. 

Work with your sales team and executive sponsor(s) to determine the key success metrics you’ll track. You want your business goals and metrics to steer your Sales Cloud implementation, not the other way around!

As you finalize your success metrics, make sure they’re SMART.

-   Specific
-   Measurable
-   Achievable
-   Relevant
-   Time-bound


## Plan for Your Users

We know that change brings up challenges for any team. Planning for how your sales team will engage with Sales Cloud helps them feel comfortable from the start. 

You want your users to be as excited about Sales Cloud as you are. Including them in the planning process is a great way to generate interest and ensure you set up Sales Cloud in a way that truly helps them reach their goals.

Beyond the planning stage, continue to ask for feedback from your team. That way, they have plenty of opportunities to tell you whether your Sales Cloud configurations are relevant to their day-to-day work, and you can make adjustments as needed. The first time you train your users on the platform should not be the first time they hear about it!

Here’s how Cloud Kicks communicated its Sales Cloud plan to their teams.
