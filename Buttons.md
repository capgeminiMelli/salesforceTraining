## Custom Buttons and Links

Every org has a unique set of business needs. If your users frequently need to access other pages in or outside your org, you can add custom buttons and links directly to object and record detail pages.

Custom buttons and links help you integrate Salesforce data with external URLs, applications, your company’s intranet, or other back-end office systems.

When your users have all the information they need on hand, they can be even more productive with Salesforce.

## What Can Custom Buttons and Links Do?

Custom links can link to an external URL, such as www.google.com, a Visualforce page, or your company’s intranet. Custom buttons can connect users to external applications, such as web pages, and launch custom links.

You can choose the display window properties that determine how the target of a link or button is displayed to your users. Custom links can include Salesforce fields as tokens within the URL. For example, you can include an account name in a URL that searches Yahoo: `http://search.yahoo.com/bin/search?p={!Account_Name}`.

In Lightning Experience, custom buttons and links live on your page layouts and appear in different areas of a Lightning page.

There are three primary types of custom buttons and links that you can create.

-   **List button**—Appears on a related list on an object record page.
-   **Detail page link**—Appears in the Links section of the record details on an object record page.
-  ** Detail page button**—Appears in the action menu in the highlights panel of a record page.
