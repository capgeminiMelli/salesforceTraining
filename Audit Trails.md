### Setting up Audit Trails

#### ❖SETUP CHANGES
- The setup audit trail history helps to track the recent setup changes that administrators have made to the org. If there are multiple administrators in the org, this is of great help in keeping a record of the changes.
#### ❖DELEGATE USER
- If a delegate (such as an administrator or customer support representative) makes a setup change on behalf of an end user, the Delegate User column shows the delegate’s username.


With audit trails you can show twenty most recent setup changes and download a trail for the last six months of changes.
