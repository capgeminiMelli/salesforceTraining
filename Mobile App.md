# [[Salesforce]] Mobile App


The Salesforce mobile app is an enterprise-class app that provides your users with instant access to your company’s CRM data from a phone or tablet. Here are some of the reasons why the app is so awesome.

-   **The mobile app is included with every Salesforce license.** Yup, you heard us correctly—it’s free. Procrastinating on your mobile rollout is basically like setting piles of money on fire.
-   **The app is plug-and-play**, which means users just download it from the App Store® or Google Play™— and go. It works out of the box with no setup required. It’s lightning fast—seriously. In the time it took you to read this paragraph, you could have already installed the app and logged in.
-   **The app is cross platform**, so it runs on Android and iOS operating systems. Like, automatically—without you having to do any development work.
-   **The app has offline capabilities.** Your mobile users won’t be affected by capricious cellular signals, FAA regulations, subway commutes, or bunker-style buildings.
-   **It works seamlessly with the desktop version of Lightning Experience**, so users can switch between the two without missing a beat.
-   **It isn’t just an app. It’s a platform.** Because the mobile app is powered by the Salesforce platform, it’s infinitely customizable. You can use point-and-click tools to make it your own.

## The Magic of Metadata

Perhaps you’re wondering how it’s possible that the Salesforce mobile app works instantly, right out of the box. The secret is your metadata.

As an admin, you’ve probably used the point-and-click tools that help you customize Salesforce. Perhaps you’ve created custom objects, tailored page layouts, built list views, and so on.

Those customizations become part of your metadata, which is just a set of definitions that describe your particular Salesforce org. And most of your customizations are automatically available in the Salesforce mobile app because it reads those definitions and displays your data accordingly.

But wait a minute. If all of your Salesforce customizations are already available in the mobile app, then why bother customizing it?
