# Develop a Rollout Strategy

## Learning Objectives

After completing this unit, you’ll be able to:

-   Identify the top priority use cases for Chatter in your organization.
-   Put together a launch plan for Chatter.
-   Decide whether to turn on Chatter for all users in your company or do a profile-based rollout of Chatter.

## Design Your Chatter Rollout Strategy

Developing a Chatter rollout strategy is critical. Because Chatter functionality is intuitive, it’s likely your user training effort will be minimal.

However, if you’re not already using a social collaboration tool, invest time in getting your company ready for a new way to communicate. For many companies, Chatter represents a cultural shift and requires champions at all levels of the organization to make it a success.

Crafting and executing a rollout plan is key to adoption. Whatever you do, don’t skip this step.

## Identify Champions

Make your first step identifying people at your company to be Chatter champions.
-   **Executive Sponsor**: Every company needs at least one executive identified as the sponsor. This person must believe in the power of social collaboration and Chatter. They must be willing to invest time to make Chatter collaboration a success. When your Executive Sponsor is actively posting in Chatter, others follow suit. Now, this person usually has a full calendar, so a good guideline for your Executive Sponsor is “one post a day.” That’s manageable and sets the right example for others to follow.
-   **Evangelist**: You can’t be everywhere at once, and with Chatter you don’t have to be. Right now, there are people at your company who have incredible knowledge and already love social collaboration. Engage those users! Formally recognize them as Chatter Evangelists, and engage them in helping drive Chatter success. Your evangelists can help answer questions, encourage other users who are nervous about posting, create and manage groups, and curate content.
-   **Community Manager**: For Chatter to soar you need great content and a sense of community. You need a Community Manager curating quality content and driving user engagement. Examples of great content include helpful files, links to industry news articles or videos, and posts about events or exciting announcements at your company. Your Community Manager drives overall engagement at a strategic level. The manager measures your results, works with evangelists, and deploys adoption programs to keep Chatter going long after rollout.

## Communication Plan

A great Chatter rollout needs a solid communication plan. Develop a plan to help you advertise and explain Chatter to your users and get them excited about what’s coming.

-   **Create Marketing Content**: You can send drip emails and videos to advertise that Chatter is coming. Consider allocating budget for fun swag or a launch party with cake and balloons. Making the launch of Chatter an event for your company helps to build excitement and momentum.
-   **Create a Schedule**: Choose your launch date carefully. Avoid busy times for your company (for example, the last day of the sales month) and holidays. It’s a general best practice to turn on Chatter after hours. Once you’ve decided on your launch date, create a schedule for your pre-launch communication. Here’s a sample communication schedule:
