## Meet Salesforce Flow

Salesforce Flow provides declarative process automation for every Salesforce app, experience, and portal.

Included in Salesforce Flow are two point-and-click automation tools: Flow Builder, which lets you build flows, and Process Builder, which lets you edit existing processes.

To sum up the differences:

-   Salesforce Flow is the name of the product.
-   Flow Builder and Process Builder and are the names of the tools.
-   Use Flow Builder to make flows; use Process Builder to refine existing processes.

## Which Automation Tool Is Right for My Use Case?

When it's all said and done, a process-driven experience isn’t backed by only one process. It’s a combination of all the business processes in your org that can impact your customer. Each business process typically falls into one of these camps.
