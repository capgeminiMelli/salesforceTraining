## Contacts to Multiple Accounts

Your contacts might work with more than one company. A business owner might own more than one company or a consultant might work on behalf of multiple organizations. Your relationships may be complicated, but keeping tabs on them doesn’t need to be.

When you relate a single contact to multiple accounts you can easily track the relationships between people and businesses without creating duplicate records. The relationship rules are still simple. Every contact needs to be associated with a primary account. This is the account that appears in Account Name and is usually the company the contact is most closely associated with. Any other accounts associated with the contact represent indirect relationships. The Related Contacts list lets you view current and past relationships, and capture unique and custom details about these relationships so you always know who you’re talking to—or who you _should_ be talking to.

## Best Practices for Establishing Account Hierarchies

You have two basic choices when you’re deciding how to establish accounts for businesses with multiple locations.

Global Enterprise Account

You could establish one global account and link all contacts, opportunities, cases, and so on to that single overarching account. Using one global account makes it easy to find that account’s records and to report on that account at the enterprise level. But it’s harder to manage a large mass of information, and not being able to easily view the big picture might make it hard to see what each location needs from you for your relationship to be successful.

Location-Specific Accounts

Establish accounts for each location and create contacts, opportunities, cases and so on separately for each location. With this option, you maintain more accounts and need to set up a few more complex reports to get the big picture. But using multiple accounts means you can take advantage of account ownership, hierarchies, specific sharing settings, and more granular reporting. You can also more easily track and report on opportunities, cases, and other interactions for each account.

We recommend establishing accounts for each separate location, rather than squeezing all locations into a single global account. This arrangement lets you concentrate on customer success in each location while still giving you the ability to put the big picture together.
