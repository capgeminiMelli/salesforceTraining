## Page Layouts

What you see when you log in to Salesforce for the first time is just the start. You can customize and personalize many things on a given object record page using page layouts.

There are two ways to customize a page in Lightning Experience. You can customize a page’s layout, or customize its contents. These are done with separate tools.

Lightning pages are a collection of Lightning components arranged in regions on the page. You can customize the structure of the page and the position of its components with the Lightning App Builder (learn more in the [Lightning App Builder](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/modules/lightning_app_builder) module right here on Trailhead).

You can customize a page’s contents, such as the fields and buttons that appear on the page, by using a different tool called the page layout editor. The page layout editor, also known as page layouts, helps you manage the content of pages in both our Classic UI and in Lightning Experience. The page layout editor is what we’ll be working with in this unit.

**The page layout editor lets you:**
-   Control which fields, lists of related records, and custom links users see
-   Customize the order that the fields appear in the page details
-   Determine whether fields are visible, read only, or required
-   Control which standard and custom buttons appear on records and related lists
-   Control which quick actions appear on the page

## Customize the Fields in Your Record Details

Customizing the fields on your record pages is easy, and you can do it with just a few clicks. The Enhanced Page Layout Editor is the go-to place for customizing a Lightning Experience record page’s fields and related lists. It’s called “enhanced” because there’s an earlier version of it. We’ll just refer to it as the page layout editor here.

The page layout editor has two basic parts: a palette on the upper portion of the screen (1) and the record’s page layout on the lower portion of the screen (2). The palette contains the basic elements—such as fields, actions, buttons, links, and related lists—that you can add and arrange on your page. You can think of the upper part as the buffet table and the lower part as the plate of food you’re assembling


Jakes interpretation: customize the fields (attributes) that are able to be seen about an object.
