## Salesforce Approvals Versus Advanced Approvals

Salesforce has standard approval functionality, which meets a lot of common use cases. But for businesses with more involved approval workflows, Salesforce CPQ offers advanced approvals (**AA**).

This figure demonstrates an approval path with multiple tiers as well as serial and parallel approvers. For some systems, something like this can be complex to implement. Not for AA.

Putting strong checks and balances in place with the right approval processes ensures a few things.

-   Reps are making appropriate commitments.
-   There are no surprises down the line for Legal or Service teams.

Simply put, you're setting the entire company up for success with accurate representation of what you can deliver. More importantly, customers will always have the right level of expectation—expectation that you can always deliver on.

### Advanced Order Management

Does a deal require that you deliver service to multiple locations at different times? Do you activate subscriptions after implementation?

With AOM, you can split orders to create multiple orders from a single quote, letting you send products to multiple locations or at different times. But what does this look like for your business? And what does it mean for your customers? 

Say you need to get a hospital up and running, or you're working on a construction job with multiple phases. You need to ship equipment at different times. Or maybe you're helping your customer implement a new piece of software in multiple offices around the world. With AOM, you can start small with one team and help them expand when it makes sense, without having to go through multiple sales cycles.
