## What’s an App?

You’re probably comfortable with the idea of app stores. Whether you’re downloading apps on your phone, tablet, computer, or other device, you have to download and install apps to make the most of your technology. Salesforce is the same way.

Salesforce has a community of partners that use the flexibility of the Salesforce platform to build amazing apps that anyone can use. These apps are available for installation on [AppExchange](https://appexchange.salesforce.com/) (some for free, some at a cost).

## What’s a Package?

A package is a set of pre-created configurations and developments. At various points in your Trailhead learning journey, you may need to install a package in order to complete a challenge or work through the steps in a badge.

Packages allow us to load sample data, custom objects and fields, or just about anything else into your Trailhead Playground.

## Install an App or Package in Your Trailhead Playground

To install an app or package in your Trailhead Playground, you just need the package ID provided in the Trailhead content. This is a long string that starts with `04t`—you’ll know it when you see it.

First things first: Launch your Trailhead Playground by going to any hands-on challenge, scrolling to the bottom of the page, and clicking **Launch**. If you see a tab in your org labeled Install a Package, fantastic! Follow the steps in the Your Playground Has the Playground Starter App section below. 

If not, click ![App Launcher](https://res.cloudinary.com/hy4kyit2a/f_auto,fl_lossy,q_70/learn/modules/trailhead_playground_management/install-apps-and-packages-in-your-trailhead-playground/images/228c9e4c13cbd715afa1613789b88e34_ck-3-p-1-mvas-000-i-0-y-5-y-7-ebp-5-jic-2-2.png) to launch the App Launcher, then click **Playground Starter** and keep reading. If you don’t see the Playground Starter app, go ahead and skip to the Your Playground Doesn’t Have the Playground Starter App section.
