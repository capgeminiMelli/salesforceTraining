## Salesforce Billing
We discuss why later in this unit. But it’s important to first identify some of the higher-level benefits.

-   **Recurring Business/Recurring Revenue**. Many companies are moving to a recurring business model. This means there’s a healthy appetite to add services or subscriptions to what they offer. Think of a manufacturing company also selling warranties, or a software company offering subscriptions. Many traditional, siloed systems do not have the functionality to manage the complexities that go along with a recurring business, such as how to treat the concept of time, contract amendments, and proration. This is where Salesforce Billing shines.
-   **True Cross-Team Collaboration**. This is a little more abstract than recurring business, but bear with us. When you’re on a single platform, working off of a single toolset, you have the ability to work more closely with teams that may have been siloed in the past. Think about introducing a new product or subscription. It’s more than just adding a line item to an order. There’s a whole process from selling to billing that you have to think through and then execute. This is the promise of our platform.

Both of these concepts come into play throughout this module. So keep them top of mind

## Finance’s Seat at the Table

It’s important to understand that even though it’s used by Sales, Salesforce CPQ really is the first stop for the Finance team, which is partly why Salesforce Billing is an add-on as opposed to a stand-alone or siloed system. 

Salesforce CPQ generates the contract, where the terms and commitments influence the way you recognize revenue. (What are our obligations and did we deliver on them in time?) It’s also where the order originates, which is key to tracking bookings and generating the invoice. Ultimately, it’s important to get these right so that Salesforce Billing can take this information and continue the process in a seamless manner through invoice to accounts receivable.

First, let’s discuss the opportunities this type of platform offers.

-   True automation can be achieved, since data can easily flow through quotes, contracts, and orders into invoicing. There is no need for recalculation, no need to reconcile differences between systems, and you can be as hands-free or as hands-on as you wish.
-   The Sales-to-Finance gap is virtually eliminated. When you think about introducing a new product or business model, or changes to processes, both teams can quickly adapt since you are on the same platform working with the same toolset—closer knit by design.

**In the end, all of these features are about giving your customers flexibility to do business with you, adding to that business on their schedule, and making sure they get what they need when they need it. And you have the flexibility to meet their demands in the fastest, most seamless way possible.**
