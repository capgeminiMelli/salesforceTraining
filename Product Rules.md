## Product Rules

CPQ product rules help ensure sales reps are putting together the right products and bundles every single time. You don’t have to worry about checking whether products and options are compatible with one another, or whether a specific SKU is appropriate for your customer’s business size and use case. We do that busy work so you can move quickly to deliver on the high expectations your customers hold for their buying experience. Increasing accuracy and customer satisfaction at the same time? That's a win-win situation if we ever saw one.


### There are four kinds of product rules: validation rules, selection rules, filter rules, and alert rules.

## Price Rules
- Price rules will also contain price conditions. For instance, if you wanted to sell 2 ink cartridges with each printer, a price rule can ensure that if you increase the quantity of printers to 3, it will also increase the quantity of ink cartridges to 6.
