Then you remember something you read: The first step in assessing data quality is to figure out how your company uses customer data to support its business objectives. Sounds like a good start.

You meet with managers and reps across Gelato and ask them:

-   What are your business objectives?
-   What customer data is required to support those objectives?
-   How are you using that customer data?
-   Where is your customer data stored?

It turns out that while each department has a unique set of objectives, many departments are using the same customer data. Unfortunately, each seems to have its own process for creating and maintaining that data. For example, nearly all departments need customer contact info. But each department uses its own source of truth for that contact info. Sales uses Salesforce, Accounting has an intricate system of spreadsheets, and Customer Support barely has any system at all. Same story with all kinds of data across the company.

You try your best to find two departments that use the same process for creating records. But you’d have more luck finding a vegetarian at a pig roast. You check with several sales managers. One tells you that her team keeps all their customer info in a shared spreadsheet. At the end of every month, her assistant transfers the info to Salesforce. That is, until her assistant quit 3 months ago. Another sales manager told his team not to worry about entering the data into Salesforce (even though it’s company policy!).
