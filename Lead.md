## Leads

Leads are people and companies that you’ve identified as potential customers. You find leads in a number of ways. Many of your leads might be referred to you by your other happy customers. You might also gather leads when customers contact you on your website, stop by your booth at a conference, or through information exchanges with partner companies. In Salesforce, information about leads is stored in Lead records.

At the trade show, you talk to Aparna Bosu. She works at Get Cloudy Consulting West and communicates regularly with Leung Chan. Leung told her about their plan to get custom shoes for the big conference in San Francisco. Aparna’s also interested, and you get her business card. When you get back to the office—or when you have a spare minute with your mobile phone—you enter her information in Salesforce as a lead. You’ll follow up with her after the trade show.

Qualifying a lead indicates that you believe in a persons business.
