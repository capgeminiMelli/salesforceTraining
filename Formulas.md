## Introduction to Formula Fields

You’ve got a lot of data in your organization. Your users need to access and understand this data at a glance without doing a bunch of calculations in their heads. Enter formula fields, the powerful tool that gives you control of how your data is displayed.

Let’s say you wanted to take two numeric fields on a record and divide them to create a percentage. Or perhaps you want to turn a field into a clickable hyperlink for easy access to important information from a record’s page layout. Maybe you want to take two dates and calculate the number of days between them. All these things and more are possible using formula fields.

Let’s look at a specific example. What if you wanted to calculate how many days are left until an opportunity’s close date? You can create a simple formula field that automatically calculates that value. By adding the value to the Opportunity page layout, your users can quickly access this key information. You can also add this field to reports and list views for instant access.


## Find the Formula Editor

Before we dive into writing formulas, let’s locate the formula editor and get to know its features.

You can create custom formula fields on any standard or custom object. To start, we’ll create a formula on the Opportunity object. Follow these steps to navigate to the formula editor.

1.  From Setup, open the Object Manager and click **Opportunity**.
2.  In the left sidebar, click **Fields & Relationships**.
3.  Click **New**.
4.  Select **Formula** and click **Next**.
5.  In **Field Label**, type My Formula Field. Notice that **Field Name** populates automatically.
6.  Select the type of data you expect your formula to return. For example, if you want to write a formula that calculates the commission a salesperson receives on a sale, you select Currency. For now, pick **Text**.
7.  Click **Next**. You’ve arrived at the formula editor! Time for our tour.
