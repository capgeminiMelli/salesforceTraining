## Heroku in the Salesforce Platform

The Heroku Platform is part of the Salesforce Platform, a multi-cloud app platform. That's quite a mouthful! We just mean that the Salesforce Platform ties together many tools and services into a cohesive platform that you can use to build valuable applications. Heroku is part of that toolset. It can enable you to build custom applications to facilitate amazing customer experiences.

You might know that Lightning Platform allows you to build employee-facing apps to customize and extend your Salesforce CRM. With Heroku you can go even further, building pixel-perfect applications for your customers in open-source languages like [Java](http://java.net/), [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/), [Python](https://www.python.org/), [PHP](http://php.net/), [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript), and [Go](https://golang.org/).

You can go beyond the bounds of Lightning Platform but stay connected to your data inside Salesforce. It's basically the best of both worlds! [Many customers](https://www.heroku.com/customers) leverage Heroku for powerful web and mobile applications that drive increased customer engagement.

Applications are made up of many different components. A typical modern-day application consists of a back-end management system with a system of record for important data (like the Lightning Platform Model layer), internal tracking and reporting tools, and a public web or mobile interface that allows customers to engage with it. Heroku gives you the ability to use open-source languages and frameworks like [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/), [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/), or [Spring](https://spring.io/) to build that public-facing interface.


## Software as a Service

[SaaS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_as_a_service) is a methodology for delivering software from the cloud without downloading and installing it on your computer. You've already used SaaS when you log in to Salesforce via the web. To better describe the concept, let's use the analogy of buying a suit. Using SaaS is like going to a department store and buying a suit off the rack. You can find something quite nice that's already made and wear it to a party that night. You could also have a tailor make minor adjustments to get a more customized fit.

As mentioned, this method is the familiar model of Salesforce that we all know and love. Behind the scenes, Salesforce engineers build, manage, and upgrade all the software for you. All you have to do is log in and use it. Simple!

## Platform as a Service

A [PaaS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_as_a_service) is a way to deliver hardware and software tools to users as a service. You can also use the hardware and tools for application development on top of the platform. So you can build your own SaaS right on top of a PaaS!

Of course, a PaaS provides less for you out of the box, but the trade-off is increased flexibility. In the clothing world, this approach is akin to going to a bespoke store where you pick out the fabric, buttons, and pattern and have the tailor make a suit that is custom fit to you. You want a yellow polka-dotted, three-piece suit? You don't have to wait for Armani to realize it's the next hot look; you can have it made to measure! You won't be able to wear it to a party tonight, but you can believe it'll be a perfect fit when it's done. And no one else will have anything like it.

This is where Heroku fits in. Heroku takes care of the hard parts of operating what lies underneath an application at Internet scale. This allows you to concentrate on creating the perfect fit and finish for your customers using the open-source languages, frameworks, and other tools that best suit your needs.
