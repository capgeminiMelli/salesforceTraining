## Configuration Attribute 
Use configuration attributes to set the value of multiple shared product option fields simultaneously. 

Its important to understand that configuration attributes are not actually fields, but are visible manifestations of fields. Think of it this way: when the product config page loads, what you see is really a page built from records -- product, option and feature records. **The page itself is not actually a record** and if the page isn't a record, it can't have its own fields.

## Global Attribute

The biggest advantage of a global attribute is that you can attach it to as many options as you like.
