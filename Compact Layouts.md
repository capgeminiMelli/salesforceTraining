## Compact Layouts

When you open a record in the Salesforce mobile app, you see highlights about that record in the header of the page. _Compact layouts_ control which fields appear in the header. For each object, you can assign up to 10 fields, including the Name field, to display in that area.

Creating and customizing compact layouts for your objects isn’t required because system defaults are provided out of the box. However, we recommend using compact layouts to put important fields into record headers to help your mobile users get the information they need quickly.

Let’s look at an example from DreamHouse Realty. D’Angelo has been experimenting with compact layouts for the Property object, and he’s pleased with the results. Check out screenshots of a property header in the mobile app before and after he customized the object’s compact layout.
